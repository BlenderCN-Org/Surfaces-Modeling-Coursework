# Project01-Mesh: Mesh Editor

In this project, we will develop a modal Blender add-on for the creation, manipulation, and committing of meshes.

The project will involve many parts, many of which will be done individually but some may require small groups.
Each student will participate by being the "owner" of a few particular features.
Other students will assist the owner by reporting bugs, requesting features, or providing patches.
